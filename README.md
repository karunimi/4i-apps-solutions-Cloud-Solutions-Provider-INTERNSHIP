# Supervised-Learning

+ Supervised learning is a machine learning approach where algorithms are trained on labeled data to make predictions or classifications accurately.

+ There are few algorithms which are classified as regressor's and classifiers, that will be covered in this.

+ Have taken dataset from seaborn and have performed the below algorithms
  
+ Algorithms Covered:

+ AS REGRESSOR
   + Linear regression
   + Decision Tree
   + Random Forest Tree

+ AS CLASSIFIER
   + Logistic Regression
   + Decision Tree
   + Random Forest
   + knn model
   + Naive Bayes model
 
NOTE: The result value may vary  each and everytime you run it.So, you may not get the same result as I got.
